# Prospective students and collaborators​
We are looking for prospective research students, as well as Master and Ph.D. students, interns, and exchange students. If you are interested in joining our team, please send email with a brief description of your research interests, academic transcript, and your resume to shuda@okayama-u.ac.jp, and cc yasuyuki.nogami@okayama-u.ac.jp .

Financial support through scholarships, such as the **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship**, is available for eligible students. We also encourage students to explore other funding opportunities to support their research.

We also welcome any kind of collaborative opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in partnering with us on research projects.​​
